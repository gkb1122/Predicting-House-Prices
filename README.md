🏡 Boston Housing Price Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project implements machine learning models from scratch to predict house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The models included are:

✅ Linear Regression
✅ Random Forest
✅ XGBoost

📊 Features & Steps

🔍 Data Preprocessing

📥 Load dataset from local storage

🔄 Handle missing values (imputation using median)

📏 Normalize numerical features

✂️ Split dataset into training & testing sets

🏗 Model Implementations (from scratch)

1️⃣ Linear Regression
2️⃣ Decision Trees (for Random Forest & XGBoost)
3️⃣ Random Forest (ensemble of decision trees)
4️⃣ XGBoost (gradient boosting with decision trees)

📈 Model Evaluation

✅ Compute Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) & R² Score

📊 Visualize model comparison with bar charts

🌟 Feature Importance

🔍 Extract & visualize important features from Random Forest

🚀 How to Run in Google Colab

1️⃣ Upload the dataset when prompted.
2️⃣ Run the script cell by cell.
3️⃣ View performance metrics and visualizations.
